# Starlink Installation and Operation in high-threat environments

Starlink can deliver internet service in areas where ground infrastructure is unavailable, unreliable, or untrustworthy. When using Starlink in high-threat environments, additional considerations should be made regarding the terminal installationâ€™s location and operation. Material in this project will provide general guidelines and tools for reducing the ability of bad actors to detect,
disrupt, or deny access to Starlink service.
